Written by `Nicolas M Mj√∏s | h578011`

## Technical Problems

None so far.

## Result
Code repository is available [here](https://github.com/NickMarcha/dat250-sparkjava-counter) 
No pending issues except for not finding the "slide 36 from the lectures on web services", I believe this was in reference to the URL paths so I implemented them as I have been taught before.
