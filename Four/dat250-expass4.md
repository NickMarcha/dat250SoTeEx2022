### Hand-in: short report

As hand-in, you must add a markdown file called `dat250-expass4.md` to the same repository that you created in the earlier software technology assignments.

In particular, you should write about:

- technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved

- a link to your code for experiments 2-4 above

- any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve

The hand-in should be written in **English**.
