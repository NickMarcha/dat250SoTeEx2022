## Lab Report: Software Technology Experiment 3: MongoDB, DAT250:

Written by `Nicolas M Mj√∏s | h578011`

### Technical Problems

- Screenshots for:

- - The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)

- - Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).

- - Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you.

- Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.

- Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve
